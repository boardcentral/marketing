<p>Last revised on April 17, 2021</p>
<h3 id="the-gist">The Gist</h3>
<p>Board Central Developers will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.</p>
<p>We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it.</p>
<p>We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.</p>
<p>That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.</p>
<h3 id="reuse">Reuse</h3>
<p>This document is based upon the <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Automattic Privacy Policy</a> and is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License 2.5</a>. Basically, this means you can use it verbatim or edited, but you must release new versions under the same license and you have to credit Automattic somewhere (like this!). Automattic is not connected with and does not sponsor or endorse Board Central Developers or its use of the work.</p>
<p>Vincent Hodges (&quot;Board Central Developers&quot;) makes available services include our web sites (https:/about.boardcentral.app/ and https://boardcentral.app/), our blog, and any other software, sites, and services offered by Board Central Developers in connection to any of those (taken together, the &quot;Service&quot;). It is Board Central Developers's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<p>If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@boardcentral.app</p>
<h3 id="visitors">Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Board Central Developers collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Board Central Developers's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Board Central Developers's visitors use its website. From time to time, Board Central Developers may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Board Central Developers also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Board Central Developers does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.</p>
<h3 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Board Central Developers's websites choose to interact with Board Central Developers in ways that require Board Central Developers to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Board Central Developers gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Board Central Developers collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Board Central Developers. Board Central Developers does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.</p>
<h3 id="aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Board Central Developers may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, Board Central Developers may monitor the most popular parts of https://about.boardcentral.app/ and https://boardcentral.app/. Board Central Developers may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Board Central Developers does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Board Central Developers discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Board Central Developers's behalf or to provide services available at Board Central Developers's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Board Central Developers will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Board Central Developers discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Board Central Developers believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Board Central Developers, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Board Central Developers may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Board Central Developers and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Board Central Developers takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. Board Central Developers uses cookies to help Board Central Developers identify and track visitors, their usage of Board Central Developers Service, and their Service access preferences. Board Central Developers visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Board Central Developers's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Board Central Developers's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h3>
<p>Board Central Developers uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Board Central Developers may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Board Central Developers's sole discretion. Board Central Developers encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. </p>
